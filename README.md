# Battery Sustainability Model
> **Under development. Updating to BatPaC V5. Final code will follow.**


Framework to calculate electric vehicle battery material intensities, battery cost, life cycle emissions, technical performance and material criticality.  

## Background
Model utilises the BatPaC (version 5) battery design model to automate the extraction of bill of materials (BOM) and performance parameters of user specific battery design parameters. The BOM is used as input to the battery cost (Python version of BatPaC cost model), LCA (Brightway2 model) and material criticality models.
